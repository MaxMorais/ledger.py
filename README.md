# ledger.py: command-line, double-entry accounting in python.

**ledger.py** is a simple, command-line, double-entry accounting system, that reads transactions
from a file written in a simple text format and produces summary reports.

## Inspiration

**ledger.py** is similar to, and partly inspired by, John Wiegley's Ledger: http://www.ledger-cli.org/.

**ledger.py** is also similar to some older double-entry accounting software I wrote using
wxPython. Although that software had a GUI, and I used it for several years, it was less convenient
to use in practice than **ledger.py**, and significantly more complex.
